# hello-world

New to github but I've been dabbling with programming for some time. 

I'm here to utilize and learn the inner workings of smart contracts and algorithmic trading strategies primarily, 
so I'll be focusing on the Python and Solidity languages for now

I also want to work on some music graphics and visualization techology so if you are into that, hmu.
NFTs are interesting as well. There's alot you can do with them that isnt cringey art

bye-world
