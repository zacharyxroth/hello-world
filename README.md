# hello-world

I'm here to learn and experiment with the inner workings of smart contracts and algorithmic trading strategies.

Currently, I'm focusing on Python but I hope to move to Solidity and Rust sooner or later.

My background is in music but I work in crypto and finance. I'm looking to make crypto my career.
